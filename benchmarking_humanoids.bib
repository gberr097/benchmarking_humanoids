  abstract  = {Describes a benchmark suite for mobile robots that provides quantitative measurements of a mobile robot's ability to perform specific tasks. Guidelines for the design of benchmark tests were derived from other areas faced with the problem of evaluating complex systems. The benchmarks test the control and accuracy of the path and trajectory tracking, the static path planning, and the dynamic path planning ability of a mobile robot. A set of metrics that provide important information about a mobile robot's performance are also presented. These benchmarks could also be used as simple games. Their inclusion in robotic games will lead to an increased opportunity for researchers to evaluate their work without having to buy expensive or special purpose equipment},
